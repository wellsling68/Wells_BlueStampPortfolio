# CNC Pen Plotter
<!---Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

For my first milestone, I fully assembled the components and wired the electronics of the pen plotter. The pen plotter kit came with assembly instructions, which I downloaded off the doesbot website, so assembly was relatively simple. The assembled pen plotter included acrylic frames, motors, guide rails, a belt, a servo for moving the pen up and down, and wires connecting the electronics to the arduino. Depending on which motors spin and which way they spin, the pen will either move in the X axis, Y axis, or both simultaneously.

The biggest challenge I had to overcome for this milestone would be assembling the acrylic parts correctly. This is because when assembling, I didn't pay attention to the orientation of the pieces I was building, so when I realized the mistakes I had made, I had to disassemble and reassemble the plotter many times. Although fixing these issues took a few extra hours to complete, I learned to be more diligent while working on this project.

After this, I plan on installing the software for the pen plotter and work on plotting the template images provided within the kit.

# Starter Project

## Summary:
For my starter project, I chose the calculator. This project was pretty simple, as it mainly involved me soldering the buttons, main chip, battery holder, and display onto the given PCB. After I finished soldering, I inserted the battery and tested the calculator by performing some basic operations. The final step before finishing the project was to assemble the provided case.

## Challenges: 
This was my first time soldering, so my soldering skills were not the best. This resulted in inconsistant solders where it was not fully filled.

## What's Next: 
I am going to start my final project, the CNC Pen Plotter.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
